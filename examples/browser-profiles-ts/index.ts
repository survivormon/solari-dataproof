/**
 * Persistent profiles — log in once, reuse the session forever.

 * A profile stores cookies + localStorage server-side. Attach it with

 * starts already logged in, so you stop paying the login (and the 2FA, and the
 * bot check) on every run.
 *
 * Run this file twice: the first run logs in and saves, the second reuses it.
