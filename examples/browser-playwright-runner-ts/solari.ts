/**
 * Runs your Playwright specs on a Solari cloud browser — no local Chromium.
 *
 * In each spec, change
 *   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
 * to
 *   import { test, expect } from './solari'
 * and change nothing else.
 *
 * Then just run `npx playwright test`. solari.global.ts mints a session
 * before the suite and releases it after, so the only thing you need in the
 * environment is SOLARI_API_KEY. Install the runner with
 * PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 — no browser binary is ever used.
 *
 * Why a fixture and not `use.connectOptions` in the config: connectOptions
 * speaks the Playwright wire protocol, and the browser server rejects any
 * client whose version does not match the one it runs (HTTP 428, matched on
 * Playwright's own User-Agent). That pin is currently patchright 1.62.2 and it
 * moves. CDP has no version gate, so connecting this way is the price of never
 * being pinned to whatever we happen to run today.
 *
 * Trade-off: overriding `context` means Playwright's own trace/video/
 * screenshot-on-failure are off. Solari's session replay is the artifact instead.
